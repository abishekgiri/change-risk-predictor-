# ReleaseGate v2.0.0 (Policy Control Plane)

**Release Date**: 2026-02-12
**Codename**: Policy Control Plane
**Tag**: `v2.0.0-policy-control-plane`

## Summary
This release transforms the project from a risk prediction heuristic (RiskBot) into a full-featured **governance control plane** (ReleaseGate). It introduces a declarative policy engine, tamper-evident audit ledger, signed checkpoints, and verifiable compliance exports.

## Key Features

### 1. Governance Control Plane
-   **Declarative Policies**: Define rules in YAML with versioning and strict schema validation.
-   **Tenant Isolation**: Strict separation of data with composite primary keys.
-   **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions for policy management vs. override approval.

### 2. Audit & Compliance
-   **Immutable Ledger**: Append-only, hash-chained ledger for all decisions.
-   **Signed Checkpoints**: Cryptographic proof of ledger integrity (daily/weekly).
-   **Proof Packs**: Exportable JSON/ZIP bundles containing all evidence required for an audit.
-   **Offline Verification**: `releasegate verify-proof-pack` command for air-gapped verification.

### 3. Reliability & Security
-   **Idempotency**: All critical operations (check, override, export) are idempotent.
-   **Replay Engine**: Deterministic replay of any historical decision.
-   **Hardened Logging**: Structured JSON logs and deterministic timeouts in Forge.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Protects against abuse and resource exhaustion.

## Breaking Changes
-   **Configuration**: `riskbot.yaml` is deprecated. Use `releasegate.yaml`.
-   **API**: Legacy endpoints for direct database writes have been removed.
-   **CLI**: Commands have been renamed (e.g., `analyze-pr` -> `evaluate`).

## Upgrade Guide
See `docs/migration_guide.md` for detailed instructions on upgrading from v1.x.

## Schema Stability
The following contracts are stable in v2.0.0:
-   `soc2_v1`: Export format for SOC2 evidence.
-   `proof_pack_v1`: Offline verification bundle format.
-   `checkpoint_v1`: Cryptographic checkpoint format.

Any changes to these schemas will trigger a major version bump (v3.0.0).
