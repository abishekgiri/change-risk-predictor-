# Legacy Documentation

This folder contains superseded docs kept only for historical reference.

These files are **not** source-of-truth for current ReleaseGate behavior.
Use active docs in `docs/` for current architecture, decision model, policy DSL, security posture, Jira config, and artifact contracts.
